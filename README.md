# Color-blindess-gene-research
This is a high-level research project of OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW and their relationships to color blindness.

# Project Steps:
1. Perform general research of each gene in UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway). Includes obtaining chromosome position, gene coordinates, and count of protein-coding regions.
2. Obtain reference protein sequences for each gene.
3. Identify pathogenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
4. Review 1000 Genomes Project data for allelic frequencies of pathogenic SNPs.
5. Summarize gene expression levels for each gene based on GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org/home/).
