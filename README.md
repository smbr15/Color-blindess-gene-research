# Color-blindess-gene-research
This is a high-level research project of OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW and their relationships to color blindness. Project was conducted and completed in July 2023.

# Project Steps:
1. Perform general research of each gene in UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway). Includes obtaining chromosome position, gene coordinates, and count of protein-coding regions.
2. Obtain reference protein sequences for each gene.
3. Identify pathogenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
4. Review 1000 Genomes Project data for allelic frequencies of pathogenic SNPs.
5. Summarize gene expression levels from GEUVADIS RNA-Sequencing Project sample files. 

# Summary of Findings:
1. Reference DNA sequence lengths:
     OPN1LW: 598 nucleotides
     OPN1MW: 2,289 nucleotides
     OPN1SW: 1,033 nucleotides
2. Based on the clinical significance categories listed in dbSNP, no pathogenic SNPs were included in the 1000 Genomes Project variant files. Only non-pathogenic/unknown clinical significance variants were analyzed.
3. The GEUVADIS RNA-Sequencing Project patient samples did not capture gene expression for OPN1MW. Gene expression values for OPN1LW were null. Only expression values for OPN1SW were analyzed.
